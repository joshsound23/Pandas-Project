# Pandas-Project
#Overview
This project analyzed data from a school summary csv and a district summary csv. THe analysis built dataframes to analyze the total students, average budget, averages for reading and  math scores and passing levels for math and reading across different schools, school types and other categories. This project gave me a very good understanding of building dataframes and utilizing many basic functions of Pandas.
